<ul>
  <li>General reading rules
    <ul>
      <li>The reading order is from left to right.</li>
      <li>The basic syntactic order is SVO: 🚹 ^🍽🍮 = I eat polenta.</li>
      <li>The passive sentence is transformed into active to respect the basic order.</li>
      <li>The subject must always be expressed.</li>
      <li>The two symbols ⌊ and ⌋ group, on the right and left, the compound signs: ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = shop, ^⌊👞🔙⌋ = return. In general, every symbols of signs (emojis and/or diacritics) whose meaning is synthetically defined from the sequence itself is delimited by these symbols.</li>
      <li>In the compounds the determined precedes the determinant: ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = shop (“house of tools”).</li>
      <li>The punctuation of the original text is preserved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Articles
    <ul>
      <li>The definite article is omitted: 🏠 = the house.</li>
      <li>The indefinite article is expressed by 1️⃣ before the noun: 1️⃣🏠 = a house.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Personal pronouns
    <ul>
      <li>The personal pronouns in the singular are: 🚹️ = I, 👆 = you, 🚹 = he, 🚺 = she, ⌊👆🎩⌋ = you (courtesy pronoun).</li>
      <li>The personal pronouns in the plural are obtained duplicating the singular: ⌊🚹️🚹️⌋ = we, ⌊👆👆⌋ = you, ⌊🚹🚹⌋ = they, ⌊🚺🚺⌋ = they, ⌊👆🎩👆🎩⌋ = you plural (pronoun of courtesy).</li>
      <li>These pronouns function both as subject pronouns and as complement pronouns.</li>
      <li>The possessive pronouns are obtained by inserting ⏩ before the personal pronoun: ⌊⏩🚹️⌋ = mine (of me). The owners are placed after the name and are invariable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Verbs
    <ul>
      <li>The verb is invariable in the person, with compulsory explicit of the subject: 🚹️^🈶 = I am, 👆^🈶 = you are, ⌊👆👆⌋^🈶 = you are.</li>
      <li>Verb marker: ^ (apostrophe to the left of the emoji). The verb with only the marker (^) applies as infinite, simple indicative, and/or present time. Example: 👞 = shoe, ^👞 = go.</li>
      <li>Past marker: ◀️ Example: 🚹️ ^⌊👞◀️⌋ = I went, I had gone (etc.).</li>
      <li>Future marker: ▶️️ Example: 🚹️ ^⌊👞▶️️⌋ = I will go, I will be gone (etc.).</li>
      <li>Gerund and present participle marker: ⬅️ Example: ^⌊👞⬅️⌋ = going, been going.</li>
      <li>Causative marker:  ➡️ Example: ^⌊➡️👞⌋ = to make it go.</li>
      <li>Reflexive marker (when not explicit in the linguistic yield of the verb): 👈 postponed to the verb. Example: ^⌊🗣🔙👈⌋ = answer to oneself.</li>
      <li>Reciprocal marker (when not explicit in the linguistic surrender of the verb): 👥 postponed to the verb. Example: ^⌊👊👥⌋ = beating each other.</li>
      <li>Conditional marker: 🎲 Example: 🚹️ ^⌊🎲👞⌋ = I would go.</li>
      <li>Marker of the imperative and exhortative: ❗️ Example: 👆 ^⌊❗👞⌋ = Go!</li>
      <li>Interrogative marker: ❓ Example: 👆 ^⌊❓👞⌋ = Are you going?</li>
      <li>Impersonal marker: 👉 Example: 👉^🌧 = Piove</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adjectives
    <ul>
      <li>The adjective is placed to the right of the noun: 🏠🔆 = beautiful house.</li>
      <li>The plural of nouns and adjectives is obtained with the duplication of the sign: 🏠 = house, ⌊🏠🏠⌋ = houses, ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = workshop, ⌊🏠🛠🏠🛠⌋ = workshops, ⌊🏠🛠⌋ 🐽 = dirty workshop, ⌊🏠🛠🏠🛠⌋ ⌊🐽🐽⌋ = dirty workshops.</li>
      <li>The marker ◀️ is inserted to the right of the corresponding verb but without deacritic ^ to indicate the past participle (with adjective or substantive value). Example: ⌊👞◀️⌋ = gone.</li>
      <li>The possessive adjectives are obtained by inserting ⏩ before the personal pronoun: ⌊⏩🚹️⌋ = mine (of me).</li>
      <li>The diminutive form is obtained by inserting 👶 after the adjective. Example: ⌊🐮👶⌋ = calf.</li>
      <li>The pejorative form is obtained by inserting 👹 after the adjective. Example: ⌊👁👹⌋ = stink eyes.</li>
      <li>Comparative: 📶 <adjective> ➡️. Example: 📶🕸➡️ = more thin then.</adjective></li>
      <li>Superlative (relative): ⌊<adjective> 💯⌋. Example:  ⌊🕸💯⌋ = the thinnest.</adjective></li>
      <li>Superlative (absolute): ⌊<adjective>🔝⌋. Esempio: ⌊🕸🔝⌋ = very thin.</adjective></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adverbs
    <ul>
      <li>The symbol ⬅️ is inserted to the right of the adjective to transform it into a adverb. Example: 🐌 = slow, ⌊🐌⬅️⌋ = slowly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Connectives and prepositions
    <ul>
      <li>And (conjunction) ➕. Example: 🏃➕ ⌊👨💟⌋ ^⌊👞🔙◀️️⌋ ▶️️️🏠 = Pinocchio and Geppetto returned home.</li>
      <li>Or, instead of (adverse): 🔁. Example: ⌊🚹🚹⌋ ^🈶 ⌊🃏🃏⌋ 🔁 ⌊🚹🚹⌋ ^🈶 ⌊👿👿⌋❗️ = They are crazy or cheating!</li>
      <li>That (objective): ⏬. Esempio: 🚹 ^⌊👀◀️️⌋ ⏬🤖 ^⌊🔄◀️️⌋ = he saw that the puppet moved. This sign can be omitted if included in the meaning of the regent verb.</li>
      <li>That/who (relative) ↪️. Example: 🏃, ↪️ ^⌊😋◀️️⌋, ^⌊🍽◀️️⌋ = Pinocchio, who was hungry, ate.</li>
      <li>Of (specification): ⏩. Example: 👃⏩🏃 = Pinocchio^s nose; 🔩⏩🚪 = piece of wood.</li>
      <li>To (direction): ▶️️. ️Example: 🚹^👞 ▶️️ 🏠 = I go home.</li>
      <li>From (origin, derivation): ◀️. ️ example: 🚹^⌊👞👇⌋◀️️🏠 = I come from home.</li>
      <li>In (inside): ⏺️. Example: 🚹^🍽⏺🏠 = I eat in the house / at home.</li>
      <li>On (above): 🔼. Example: ^📈🔼 = climb up.</li>
      <li>Down (below): 🔽. Example: 📎👅🔽 = with the language down.</li>
      <li>Above something: ⤵️. Example: 🚹⌊📥◀️️⌋🔨⤵️⛩ = he put the hammer on the table.</li>
      <li>Under something: ⤴️. Example: 🚹⌊📥 ◀️ ️⌋⌊👞👞⌋⤴️🛏 = he put his shoes under the bed.</li>
      <li>At the center of (between, in the middle of): 🎯. Example: 🎯⌊🔲🏠⌋ = in the center of the room.</li>
      <li>With (company): 📎. Example: 🏃^⌊👞🔙◀️⌋ ▶️️️🏠📎⌊👨💟⌋ = Pinocchio returned home with Geppetto.</li>

      <li>For (in order to): ↗️. Example: ↗️🏃^⌊👐◀️️⌋⌊⚜️⚜️⌋ = so that/for Pinocchio to deliver the coins.</li>
      <li>Towards, against, in front of, against: 🆚. Example: ⌊👨💟⌋^⌊🔄◀️️⌋🆚🏃 = Geppetto turned to Pinocchio.</li>
      <li>So that (consecutive): 🔝➡️ (also displaced in the phrase). Example: 🏃^⌊😱◀️️⌋⌊🔝➡️⌋🚹^⌊🍃◀️️⌋ = Pinocchio was so frightened that he trembled.</li>
      <li>Although (concessive) ⌊➕👍🎲⌋ Example: ⌊➕👍🎲⌋🏃🙅^⌊🙏‼️◀️️⌋, 🏃^⌊👞◀️️⌋▶️️🏠  = although he didn^t want to (even if he didn^t want), Pinocchio went home.</li>
    </ul>
