# Grammar

* General reading rules
   - The reading order is from **left to right**.
   - The basic **syntactic order** is SVO: 🚹 ^🍽🍮 = I eat polenta.
   - The **passive sentence** is transformed into active to respect the basic order.
   - The **subject** must always be expressed.
   - The two symbols ⌊ and ⌋ group, on the right and left, the compound signs: ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = shop, ^⌊👞🔙⌋ = return. In general, every symbols of signs (emojis and/or diacritics) whose meaning is synthetically defined from the sequence itself is delimited by these symbols.
   - In the compounds the **determined precedes the determinant**: ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = shop ("house of tools").
   - The **punctuation** of the original text is preserved.

* Articles
   - The **definite article** is omitted: 🏠 = the house.
   - The **indefinite article** is expressed by 1️⃣ before the noun: 1️⃣🏠 = a house.

* Personal pronouns
   - The **personal pronouns** in the singular are: 🚹️ = I, 👆 = you, 🚹 = he, 🚺 = she, ⌊👆🎩⌋ = you (courtesy pronoun).
   - The **personal pronouns in the plural** are obtained duplicating the singular: ⌊🚹️🚹️⌋ = we, ⌊👆👆⌋ = you, ⌊🚹🚹⌋ = they, ⌊🚺🚺⌋ = they, ⌊👆🎩👆🎩⌋ = you plural (pronoun of courtesy).
   - These pronouns function both as **subject pronouns** and as **complement pronouns**.
   - The **possessive pronouns** are obtained by inserting ⏩ before the personal pronoun: ⌊⏩🚹️⌋ = mine (of me). The owners are placed after the name and are invariable.

* Verbs
   - The **verb** is invariable in the person, with compulsory explicit of the subject: 🚹️^🈶 = I am, 👆^🈶 = you are, ⌊👆👆⌋^🈶 = you are.
   - Verb marker: ^ (circumflex to the left of the emoji). The verb with only the marker (^) applies as infinite, simple indicative, and/or present time. Example: 👞 = shoe, ^👞 = go.
   - **Past** marker: ◀️ Example: 🚹️ ^⌊👞◀️⌋ = I went, I had gone (etc.).
   - **Future** marker: ▶️️ Example: 🚹️ ^⌊👞▶️️⌋ = I will go, I will be gone (etc.).
   - **Gerund** and **present participle** marker: ⬅️ Example: ^⌊👞⬅️⌋ = going, been going.
   - **Causative** marker:  ➡️ Example: ^⌊➡️👞⌋ = to make it go.
   - **Reflexive** marker (when not explicit in the linguistic yield of the verb): 👈 postponed to the verb. Example: ^⌊🗣🔙👈⌋ = answer to oneself.
   - **Reciprocal** marker (when not explicit in the linguistic surrender of the verb): 👥 postponed to the verb. Example: ^⌊👊👥⌋ = beating each other.
   - **Conditional** marker: 🎲 Example: 🚹️ ^⌊🎲👞⌋ = I would go.
   - Marker of the **imperative** and **exhortative**: ❗️ Example: 👆 ^⌊❗👞⌋ = Go!
   - **Interrogative** marker: ❓ Example: 👆 ^⌊❓👞⌋ = Are you going?
   - **Impersonal** marker: 👉 Example: 👉^🌧 = Piove

* Adjectives
   - The **adjective** is placed to the **right of the noun**: 🏠🔆 = beautiful house.
   - The **plural** of nouns and adjectives is obtained with the duplication of the sign: 🏠 = house, ⌊🏠🏠⌋ = houses, ⌊🏠🛠⌋ = workshop, ⌊🏠🛠🏠🛠⌋ = workshops, ⌊🏠🛠⌋ 🐽 = dirty workshop, ⌊🏠🛠🏠🛠⌋ ⌊🐽🐽⌋ = dirty workshops.
   - The marker ◀️ is inserted to the right of the corresponding verb but without deacritic ^ to indicate the **past participle** (with adjective or substantive value). Example: ⌊👞◀️⌋ = gone.
   - The **possessive adjectives** are obtained by inserting ⏩ before the personal pronoun: ⌊⏩🚹️⌋ = mine (of me).
   - The **diminutive form** is obtained by inserting 👶 after the adjective. Example: ⌊🐮👶⌋ = calf.
   - The **pejorative form** is obtained by inserting 👹 after the adjective. Example: ⌊👁👹⌋ = stink eyes.
   - **Comparative**: 📶 <adjective> ➡️. Example: 📶🕸➡️ = more thin then.
   - **Superlative (relative)**: ⌊<adjective> 💯⌋. Example:  ⌊🕸💯⌋ = the thinnest.
   - **Superlative (absolute)**: ⌊<adjective>🔝⌋. Esempio: ⌊🕸🔝⌋ = very thin.
